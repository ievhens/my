        <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
        <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form<span class="formula">ax + b = 0 </span>where <span class="variable">a</span> and <span class="variable">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="variable">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an x so don't get too locked into always seeing an <span class="variable">x</span> there.</p>
        <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>
        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:<span class="formula">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span>where <span class="variable">a</span>, <span class="variable">b</span>, <span class="variable">c</span> are known values and <span class="variable">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="variable">a</span> can't be 0.</p>
        <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
        <p><span class="variable">&pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="variable">r</span>) squared:
            <span class="formula">A = &pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup></span>
            or, when you know the diameter (<span class="variable">D</span>):
            <span class="formula">A = &pi; / 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></span>
            or, when you know the circumference (<span class="variable">C</span>):
            <span class="formula">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &pi;</span>
        </p>
        <h3>Intersection</h3>
        <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="variable">A</span> and <span class="variable">B</span>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,<span class="formula">A &cap; B = { x : x &#8714; A and x &#8714; B }</span>That is, <span class="variable">x</span> is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if <span class="variable">x</span> is both an element of <span class="variable">A</span> and an element of <span class="variable">B</span>.</p>
